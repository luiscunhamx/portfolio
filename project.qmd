## Carta de Missão (Mission Statement)

Over the next five years, I commit to consolidating the University of Aveiro as a **national and international reference in genetics, genomics, and soil ecology**, advancing both scientific discovery and pedagogical innovation.  

As a researcher, I will deepen our understanding of **soil biodiversity and ecosystem resilience**, integrating high-throughput *omics* methods and ecological models. Building on my leadership in Horizon Europe projects (*BENCHMARKS, SYBERAC, PRESINMED*), and my experience in securing **over €1M directly for Portuguese institutions as PI/PI at UC**, I will establish a **Soil Genomics Hub** at Aveiro, ensuring the university’s leadership in the European Soil Strategy 2030.  

As a teacher, I will **enrich UA’s curricula** in *Genetics, Biologia do Genoma, Bioinformática, Biotecnologia Ambiental,* and *Evolução Biológica e Molecular*, embedding **real-world case studies** and **open science practices** into student learning. I will develop new teaching modules on **Applied Genomics for Ecology and Sustainability**, ensuring that undergraduate, MSc, and PhD students gain not only technical expertise but also the capacity to innovate responsibly.  

As a mentor, I will expand the supervision of MSc and PhD students, embedding them in international projects and fostering **capacity building and career development**. I will continue to promote **open science and reproducibility**, empowering students to be both skilled scientists and responsible global citizens.  

As a citizen-scientist, I will strengthen **societal cooperation** by engaging with farmers, NGOs, and policymakers, promoting citizen science initiatives on soil biodiversity, and translating cutting-edge genomic research into **practical guidelines for sustainable land management**.  

My mission is to unite **science, teaching, and society** under the same purpose:  
- **Healthy soils** as the foundation of resilient ecosystems and food security.  
- **Thriving students** as the next generation of scientists and innovators.  
- **Engaged communities** as co-creators of sustainable futures.  

This is my **scientific, pedagogical, and societal commitment** to the University of Aveiro.

## Vision

My vision for the next five years at the University of Aveiro is to build a **research and teaching program that bridges genetics, genomics, and ecology to address the grand challenges of our time**: soil degradation, biodiversity loss, and the urgent need for sustainable agriculture under climate change.  

I have devoted my career to **unravelling the complexity of life belowground**—from soil fauna and microbiomes to the molecular networks that sustain ecosystems. This is not only my profession but also my passion: to understand how soils breathe, adapt, and sustain life. I envision Aveiro becoming a **hub for functional soil genomics**, where laboratory and field research converge with advanced *omics* and bioinformatics to generate knowledge that is **scientifically transformative, pedagogically inspiring, and socially impactful**.  

This vision is grounded in a simple conviction: **healthy soils mean a healthier future for humanity**. I want to train students not just as scientists, but as custodians of the living earth, capable of thinking critically, innovating responsibly, and engaging with society.

## Scientific Objectives

Over my career, I have published in leading journals such as *Global Change Biology*, *Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution*, *BMC Genetics*, and *Soil Biology & Biochemistry*, collaborating with more than **200 co-authors worldwide**. My research integrates classical ecology with molecular and computational biology, seeking to answer one key question: *How does biodiversity drive ecosystem resilience?*  

### 1. Deepen understanding of soil biodiversity through functional genomics
- Develop and apply **metabarcoding, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics** to characterize soil biodiversity and functional networks.  
- Extend ongoing work from **Horizon Europe consortia** (BENCHMARKS, SYBERAC, PRESINMED) into new frameworks at UA, focusing on the functional interplay between microbes, earthworms, and plants.  
- Advance the pioneering concept of **“Precision Biota Management”**, integrating soil fauna and microbiomes as active tools in sustainable agriculture:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  

### 2. Establish experimental models linking soil amendments and biota
- Refine and deploy the **Terra Preta Nova (TPN v.2) system**, inspired by Amazonian Dark Earths, as a model for testing soil amelioration strategies.  
- Integrate **biochar–earthworm–microbe systems** to enhance carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, and resilience under Mediterranean rain-fed agriculture.  
- Apply **multi-omics pipelines** to decode plant–soil–fauna interactions, setting international benchmarks for soil health indicators.  

### 3. Consolidate leadership and funding capacity
- To date, I have contributed to securing **nearly €48M in competitive research funding**, with **€5.8M directly allocated to the University of Coimbra**.  
- As **PI or PI at UC**, I have personally secured **over €1M for UC**, including the **FCT Scientific Employment Stimulus (2018)** and PI roles in *BENCHMARKS* and *La Caixa Monte Regen Hub*.  
- My aim is to **expand this trajectory at UA**, targeting Horizon Europe calls, FCT funding lines, and Lusophone cooperation programs, ensuring the growth of an independent and sustainable research team.  

### 4. Build a Soil Genomics Hub at UA
- Establish a **laboratory and training platform in environmental genomics**, combining UA’s strengths in biotechnology, molecular biology, and ecology.  
- Link soil biodiversity research with UA’s existing infrastructures in **bioinformatics and biotechnology**, ensuring students gain hands-on training with reproducible workflows, open data, and international collaborations.  
- Position UA as a **reference institution in soil health and genomics**, aligned with the European Soil Strategy for 2030.

## Teaching Objectives

Teaching has always been central to my career. I have been recognized for excellence in pedagogy—elected *Best Student Partnership Lecturer* at the University of South Wales (2019)—and I see teaching as **an act of mentorship, inspiration, and transformation**.  

At the University of Aveiro, I will align my teaching activities with both **core curricula and innovative new modules**, integrating research-led education into undergraduate and postgraduate training.  

### 1. Contribute to core teaching at BSc and MSc levels
- Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics (*Genética*, *Biologia Molecular*, *Biologia do Genoma*, *Bioinformática*).  
- Ecology and Environmental Biology (*Evolução Biológica e Molecular*, *Indicadores Biológicos de Poluição*).  
- Applied courses where my expertise in experimental design, ecotoxicogenomics, and soil biology adds value (*Planeamento Experimental e Análise de Dados Biológicos*, *Biotecnologia Ambiental*).  

### 2. Develop new teaching content
- Design a module on **Applied Genomics for Ecology and Sustainability**, merging case studies from Horizon Europe projects with hands-on molecular and computational training.  
- Create interdisciplinary teaching materials that bridge molecular biology, ecology, and environmental biotechnology, directly tailored to UA’s MSc in Molecular and Cellular Biology and MSc in Applied Ecology.
