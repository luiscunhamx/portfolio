## About

I am a Molecular Ecologist and Researcher at the University of Coimbra (CFE), specializing in *soil biodiversity, functional genomics, and bioinformatics*. My work focus on how disturbance and management practices shape soil communities and ecosystem functions, integrating morphological data with multi-marker genetic approaches and high-throughput sequencing (Nanopore, Illumina; RNA-Seq, genome assembly, metabarcoding, metagenomics).  

I combine broad laboratory expertise, from DNA extraction, PCR, library preparation, sequencing, flow cytometry, and genomic marker development to probe-based DNA enrichment and rigorous quality control, with reproducible computational workflows (mostly using R, Python, Conda/Bioconda). This integrative approach links molecular tools with ecological knowledge to deliver actionable insights for conservation, agriculture, and climate resilience but alSO allow replicability within my team and collaboration network.  

I currently coordinate the **Environmental Genomics Laboratory (EnGeL-UC)** at UC Biotech and I co-coordinate the [Soil Health Research Group](https://cfe.uc.pt/grupos-de-investigacao/saude-do-solo/) at the **Centre of Functional Ecology (CFE)** and [Thematic Line #2](https://labterra.pt/thematic-lines/) (Sustainable agriculture, forestry and fisheries) at Laboratorio Terra. I have contributed as PI, Co-I, and researcher to projects totalling **~â‚¬48M**, including Horizon Europe initiatives such as **BENCHMARKS, GOOD, VALERECO, SYBERAC**, of which **~â‚¬5.5M** were allocated to the University of Coimbra. My international collaborations span EMBRAPA (Brazil), Cardiff University (UK), and European research networks. As **PI/PI at UC**, I have secured **>â‚¬1M** directly for UC, while as **Researcher** in international consortia I contributed to **>â‚¬28M** in projects, including **~â‚¬4.7M** for UC. This record highlights my ability to attract funding and to strengthen UCâ€™s position in major frameworks such as **Horizon Europe**.  

As experienced educator, I have delivered over **1,560 hours of teaching** in Portugal and the UK across BSc and MSc programmes, covering conservation genetics, wildlife management, research skills, field ecology, and biostatistics. I supervise both MSc and PhD students and contribute to pedagogical innovation through curriculum design and laboratory manuals.  

Beyond academia, I keep engagement with agricultural stakeholders to promote soil health monitoring and sustainable land management. My vision is to advance molecular ecology as a bridge between fundamental science and societal needs, strengthening biodiversity conservation and ecosystem resilience in a changing world.
