This is not only my profession but also my passion: to understand how soils breathe, adapt, and sustain life. I envision Aveiro becoming a **hub for functional soil genomics**, where laboratory and field research converge with advanced *omics* and bioinformatics to generate knowledge that is **scientifically transformative, pedagogically inspiring, and socially impactful**.  \n\nThis vision is grounded in a simple conviction: **healthy soils mean a healthier future for humanity**. I want to train students not just as scientists, but as custodians of the living earth, capable of thinking critically, innovating responsibly, and engaging with society.\n\n---\n\n## Scientific Objectives\n\nOver my career, I have published in leading journals such as *Global Change Biology*, *Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution*, *BMC Genetics*, and *Soil Biology & Biochemistry*, collaborating with more than **200 co-authors worldwide**. My research integrates classical ecology with molecular and computational biology, seeking to answer one key question: *How does biodiversity drive ecosystem resilience?*  \n\n### 1. Deepen understanding of soil biodiversity through functional genomics\n- Develop and apply **metabarcoding, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics** to characterize soil biodiversity and functional networks.  \n- Extend ongoing work from **Horizon Europe consortia** (BENCHMARKS, SYBERAC, PRESINMED) into new frameworks at UA, focusing on the functional interplay between microbes, earthworms, and plants.  \n- Advance the pioneering concept of **“Precision Biota Management”**, integrating soil fauna and microbiomes as active tools in sustainable agriculture:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  \n\n### 2. Establish experimental models linking soil amendments and biota\n- Refine and deploy the **Terra Preta Nova (TPN v.2) system**, inspired by Amazonian Dark Earths, as a model for testing soil amelioration strategies.  \n- Integrate **biochar–earthworm–microbe systems** to enhance carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, and resilience under Mediterranean rain-fed agriculture.  \n- Apply **multi-omics pipelines** to decode plant–soil–fauna interactions, setting international benchmarks for soil health indicators.  \n\n### 3. Consolidate leadership and funding capacity\n- To date, I have contributed to securing **nearly €48M in competitive research funding**, with **€5.8M directly allocated to the University of Coimbra**.  \n- As **PI or PI at UC**, I have personally secured **over €1M for UC**, including the **FCT Scientific Employment Stimulus (2018)** and PI roles in *BENCHMARKS* and *La Caixa Monte Regen Hub*.  \n- My aim is to **expand this trajectory at UA**, targeting Horizon Europe calls, FCT funding lines, and Lusophone cooperation programs, ensuring the growth of an independent and sustainable research team.  \n\n### 4. Build a Soil Genomics Hub at UA\n- Establish a **laboratory and training platform in environmental genomics**, combining UA’s strengths in biotechnology, molecular biology, and ecology.  \n- Link soil biodiversity research with UA’s existing infrastructures in **bioinformatics and biotechnology**, ensuring students gain hands-on training with reproducible workflows, open data, and international collaborations.  \n- Position UA as a **reference institution in soil health and genomics**, aligned with the European Soil Strategy for 2030.  \n\n---\n\n## Teaching Objectives\n\nTeaching has always been central to my career. I have been recognized for excellence in pedagogy—elected *Best Student Partnership Lecturer* at the University of South Wales (2019)—and I see teaching as **an act of mentorship, inspiration, and transformation**.  \n\nAt the University of Aveiro, I will align my teaching activities with both **core curricula and innovative new modules**, integrating research-led education into undergraduate and postgraduate training.  \n\n### 1. Contribute to core teaching at BSc and MSc levels\n- Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics (*Genética*, *Biologia Molecular*, *Biologia do Genoma*, *Bioinformática*).  \n- Ecology and Environmental Biology (*Evolução Biológica e Molecular*, *Indicadores Biológicos de Poluição*).  \n- Applied courses where my expertise in experimental design, ecotoxicogenomics, and soil biology adds value (*Planeamento Experimental e Análise de Dados Biológicos*, *Biotecnologia Ambiental*).  \n\n### 2. Develop new teaching content\n- Design a module on **Applied Genomics for Ecology and Sustainability**, merging case studies from Horizon Europe projects with hands-on molecular and computational training.  \n- Create interdisciplinary teaching materials that bridge molecular biology, ecology, and environmental biotechnology, directly tailored to UA’s MSc in Molecular and Cellular Biology and MSc in Applied Ecology.  \n\n### 3. Supervision and capacity building\n- I currently supervise **two PhD students** as main supervisor, **one PhD as co-supervisor**, and **two MSc-trained technicians** under Horizon Europe projects.  \n- Over the years, I have supervised and co-supervised **multiple MSc and undergraduate theses**.  \n- At UA, I plan to expand this role, embedding MSc and PhD projects within Horizon Europe and FCT projects, ensuring students benefit from **international collaborations and real-world research exposure**.  \n\n### 4.
